# Diabetes Detection - Jupyter Notebook Project

A machine learning project to detect diabetes using health-related data from the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. Multiple models, including XGBoost and Neural Networks, are used and compared.

## Steps Performed in the Notebook

1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Visualize data (histograms, correlation heatmaps)  
3. Preprocess the data (handle missing/zero values, scaling)  
4. Split data into training and test sets  
5. Build ML models:
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - XGBoost  
   - Neural Network (TensorFlow)  
6. Evaluate models using:
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report  
   - ROC Curve  
7. Visualize training curves for the Neural Network  
8. Compare all model performances

## Visualizations Included

- Correlation heatmap of features  
- Histogram distributions of each feature  
- Confusion matrix for all models  
- ROC curves for model comparisons  
- Neural Network training loss/accuracy graphs
